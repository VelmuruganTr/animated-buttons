Get ready to add a touch of cyberpunk cool to your web projects with animated neon shutter lock buttons in CSS! This README will guide you through the key ingredients for crafting these eye-catching interactive elements.

Ingredients:

Base Structure: We'll start with a simple HTML button element, like <button>Lock</button>.

Glowing Neon Style: Apply some CSS magic to paint the button in a vibrant neon hue. Think electric blues, pulsating pinks, or radioactive greens. You can use either solid colors or gradients for an extra dynamic effect.

Shutter Lock Icon: Add a sleek shutter lock icon to the button using CSS pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after. Get creative with the design â€“ think geometric shapes, lines, or even minimalist padlock outlines.

Animated Transitions: This is where things get electrifying! Implement CSS transitions to transform the button on hover, click, or any other interaction. Imagine the neon lock icon pulsating, sliding open, or shrinking into a glowing dot.

Optional: Neon Outline Glow: Elevate your button further with a neon outline that shimmers on hover or click. This adds an extra layer of depth and interactivity.
